    "### Introduction\n",
    "CV Job Matching using Doc2Vec is a technique that aims to match job descriptions with resumes by representing them as numerical vectors using the Doc2Vec model. This approach allows for efficient comparison and similarity calculation between textual documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of machine learning, representing text documents numerically is a challenging task. However, it is essential for various applications, such as document retrieval, web search, spam filtering, and topic modeling. Doc2Vec, a variation of the Word2Vec algorithm, provides a solution by generating vector representations from words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word2Vec** algorithms, such as **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)** and **Skip-Gram**, are used to create Word2Vec representations. CBOW predicts the current word based on the surrounding words in a sliding window context. Each word is then converted into a feature vector, and these vectors become the word vectors after training. On the other hand, Skip-Gram predicts the surrounding words given the current word. It is slower than CBOW but is known for its accuracy with infrequent words."

    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement CV Job Matching using Doc2Vec, we start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the job data from a CSV file. We preprocess the data, keeping only the relevant columns, and merge them into a new column called 'data.' Then, we tokenize the words in the 'data' column and tag them with unique identifiers using the TaggedDocument class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we initialize the Doc2Vec model with specific parameters, such as the vector size, minimum count, and number of epochs. We build the vocabulary by feeding the tagged data to the model, and then train the model on the tagged data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, we save the model for future use. To match a resume with a job description, we load the saved model and preprocess the resume and job description text. We convert them to lowercase, remove punctuation and numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the trained model, we infer the document vectors for the resume and job description. Then, we calculate the cosine similarity between the two vectors to determine the match between the resume and the job description. The cosine similarity score ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect match and -1 indicating no similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing Doc2Vec and cosine similarity, this approach enables efficient and effective matching between job descriptions and resumes, helping to streamline the job application process and enhance the chances of finding the right candidates for specific positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the author also employs Gauge chart from Plotly to show the matching percentage with threshold that users could consider modifying thier CV to pass Application Tracking System (TSA) from the majority of employers."

    "- `hs`: If set to 1, hierarchical softmax activation function will be used. Default: 0 (Negative Sampling).\n",
    "- `negative`: If > 0, negative sampling will be used, the int for negative specifies how many \"noise words\" should be drawn. Default: 5.\n",
